# hello-world

Hi prople!
 Prashanth aka codeprime-007 is here, geting started with github journey. This environment seems a little messy with newly introduced "cachy" names to me. But, i hope i'll learn it fast and fall in love with github.
 I created this almost an year ago...but getting started on 08-06-2021. Remember this dateðŸ˜‰.
 I am an CS undergraduate(currenty fresher going to be a sophomore in a month) from India.
 Nothing more to say about this. and yes very curious to solve real world problems with coding!
